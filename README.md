Content is derived from appendix 10530_2009_9594_MOESM1_ESM.docx of Gandhi, K. J. K., &amp; Herms, D. A. (2009). North American arthropods at risk due to widespread Fraxinus mortality caused by the Alien Emerald ash borer. Biological Invasions, 12(6), 1839â€“1846. doi:10.1007/s10530-009-9594-1

Please note that the original table contains entries like "host 1, host2" and "ref 1, ref 2" in a single line. These were expanded to "host 1, ref 1", "host 2, ref 1", "host 1, ref 2" to make pairwise interaction records. In addition, the reference were matched with the attached references.tsv and expanded for ease of downstream parsing.

In addition, column was introduce to make the interaction term explicit. Also, some columns with header friendly to GloBI where added, like sourceTaxonName, targetTaxonName and citation .  

Please cite the original paper when using this data.
